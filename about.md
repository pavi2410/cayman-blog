Hi, I'm Pavitra, living in India. I'm 17 years old and I study in Class 12. I like to explore and make new things.

I've learnt Java, Python, HTMl, JavaScript, but I'm more skilled at Java and Python. Out of them, I like Python the most as it os simple.

I'm also experienced at using App Inventor. I've created many extensions that are very useful at providing features that were not yet available with App Inventor. With my knowledge in Java and experience with App Inventor, I and some of my friends started a whole new Android app builder, [Makeroid](https://makeroid.io). It is based on App Inventor and has much more improvements over it.
