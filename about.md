Hi, I'm Pavitra, living in India. I'm <script>document.write(new Date(new Date() - new Date('24 Oct 2000')).getFullYear() - 1970)</script> years old. I like to explore and make new things.

I've know Java, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Kotlin, Groovy, but I'm more skilled at Java and Python. Out of them, I like Python the most as it is the simplest of all, but I also like the portability of JavaScript.

I'm also experienced at using App Inventor. I've created many extensions that are very useful at providing features that were not yet available with App Inventor. With my knowledge in Java and experience with App Inventor, I and some of my "online" friends (whom I met through [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com) [community](https://community.thunkable.io)) started a whole new Android app builder, [Kodular](https://kodular.io) (formerly [Makeroid](https://makeroid.io)). It is based on App Inventor and has much more improvements over it with a refreshing design.
